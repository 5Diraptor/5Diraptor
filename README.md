### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

##### Me on a line:
* I'm a casual full-stack web developer.  I create web apps and work on web-based projects for a hobby.

##### [/Now:](https://nownownow.com "See the Now project")
* I'm currently working on some custom wordpress plugins and gaining a deeper insight of how wordpress works with SQL.

##### Next:
* I'd like to use my experience and enjoyment of developing webapps to build something that could earn me a living on it's own


### Some stuff
* Built a chrome extension that removes ads and promoted material from Linkedin [goto repo](https://github.com/5Diraptor/ "Visit the repository for this project")
* Built a wordpress plugin for creating an audio playlist [goto repo](https://github.com/5Diraptor/ "Visit the repository for this project")
