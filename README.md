      <h5><a href="https://5Diraptor.com" title="Visit my dev website.  Not that exciting, mostly it's used as a testbed for projects - easiest to run PHP off a standard server you see.">Me: </a>I'm a casual full-stack web developer.  I create web apps and work on<br>web-based projects for a hobby.</h5>
      <h5><a href="https://nownownow.com" title="See the /Now project.  It's actually a jolly nifty idea.">/Now: </a>I'm currently working on some custom wordpress plugins and<br>gaining a deeper insight of how wordpress works with SQL.</h5>
      <h5>Next: I'd like to use my experience and enjoyment of developing webapps<br>to build something that could earn me a living on it's own</h5>

### Shout out
[Here's a shout out to a few projects that I think are particularly outstanding.](https://github.com/stars/5Diraptor/lists/shout-out "Seriously, some projects here on github have saved my arse, if I meet the creators in person I'd give them a jolly good hearty slap on the back.").

### Some little projects I'm dead chuffed about:
* Built a chrome extension that removes ads and promoted posts from Linkedin.  [Give it a whirl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cleanup-linkedin/jpnappbebbldpfefhgfphjpjfcdkonac?hl=en-GB) or [goto repo](https://github.com/5Diraptor/ "Visit the repository for this project").
* Built a wordpress plugin for creating an audio playlist [goto repo](https://github.com/5Diraptor/ "Visit the repository for this project")
* [Built a Wordle answer cracking tool](https://5diraptor.com/toolkit/cracking-wordle/).  This uses a massive database to analyse the next best possible wordle answer - based on what YOU put in.

### People that aren't gits üòÅ
* [Interesting people to follow](https://github.com/5Diraptor?tab=following "These are people I follow.  Pretty decent lot.")
* [People with good taste üòú](https://github.com/5Diraptor?tab=followers "People that follow me.  Why?")
