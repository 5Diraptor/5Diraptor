### Hello there 👋

I'm a casual web developer with experience in CMS's like in Wordpress and Magento and a good all round understanding of the stack.  I create full stack applications and web projects for a hobby.  I'm currently working on some custom wordpress plugins and gaining a deeper insight of how wordpress works with SQL.
